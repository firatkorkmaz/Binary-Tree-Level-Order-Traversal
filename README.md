# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
A program written in C++ to traverse binary trees by level order with addition of nodes to a vector.

## Demonstration

**Example Binary Tree:**
```
       1
   2       3
 4   5   6   7
8 9 - - 0 - 1 2
```
**Output:**
```
1
2 3
4 5 6 7
8 9 0 1 2
```

## Setup & Run
Compile the *Binary_Tree_Level_Order_Traversal.cpp* file with a C++ compiler and run the executable file.
```
g++ Binary_Tree_Level_Order_Traversal.cpp
```
